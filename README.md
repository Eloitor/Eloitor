I'm moving to Codeberg, [this is why](https://sneak.berlin/20200307/the-case-against-microsoft-and-github). 
Take a look at https://nrk.neocities.org/articles/miserable-state-of-github-moderation too

I'll use Github only to contribute to other projects.

== I'm Using GitHub Under Protest ==

GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I'm deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.
